### Integration with Desktop Automation
The GUI applications are designed to integrate with your desktop automation system:

```python
# Example: Handle voice commands from GUI
def handle_voice_command(command):
    if command["command"] == "build-app":
        app_type = command["parameters"].get("type")
        app_name = command["parameters"].get("name")
        # Trigger your app building logic
        build_application(app_type, app_name)
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Escape**: Close floating recorder
- **Click and Drag**: Move floating window
- **Click Microphone**: Start/stop recording

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### GUI Not Appearing
```bash
# Check if dependencies are installed
pip3 install customtkinter pillow

# Check if Whisper is working
python3 test_whisper.py
```

### Recording Issues
- **Check microphone permissions** in System Preferences
- **Speak clearly and loudly**
- **Ensure quiet environment**

### Performance Issues
- **Close other applications** using microphone
- **Restart the application** if it becomes unresponsive
- **Check system resources** (CPU, memory)

## üéØ Integration Examples

### With Hammerspoon (Desktop Automation)
```lua
-- In your Hammerspoon config
function handleVoiceCommand(command)
    if command == "build-app" then
        -- Trigger app building
        hs.execute("npx create-react-app my-app")
    elseif command == "record-meeting" then
        -- Start screen recording
        startScreenRecording()
    end
end
```

### With AppleScript
```applescript
-- Handle voice commands
on handleVoiceCommand(commandText)
    if commandText contains "build app" then
        tell application "Terminal"
            do script "npx create-react-app my-app"
        end tell
    end if
end handleVoiceCommand
```

## üéâ Success Indicators
